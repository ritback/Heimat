<h3>About:</h3>
<p>Album art-work I made for the band: Foster & Goldstein.</p>

<p>The band wanted "...a law office business card on acid".</p>

<p>The background was made with a procedural texture. It's a manipulation of Perlin's noise texture. The colors are added using Perlin's different noises.</p>
<p>I used a GUI add-on of OpenFramework to create a software where it's possible to play with differents parameters. The software has an animation you can use to stop and export textures in HD.</p>

<p>The font is Times New Roman! I love to play with classical fonts and make them my own. Point by point I retouch the font to obtain exactly what I want.</p>
