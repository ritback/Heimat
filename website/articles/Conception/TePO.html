<h3>About:</h3>
<p>When Teenage Engineering launch their first series of Pocket Operators groove boxes, everyone was crazy about designing cases for these little babies.</p>
                                <p>This is my shot to it. The case was 3D printed and it was a great fit. But after I started building my eurorack modules I endend integrating them within the system. So I scrapped the cases I made.</p>
