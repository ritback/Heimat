<h3>About:</h3>
<p>My project of doom. I once launch myself into making my own eboard. I don't know why exactly but it has been a endless series of failure. As I'm speaking right now I've relaunched the project. So there's more to come.</p>
                                <p>This is the custom part that mount the truck and fix the motor on the board. A pulley system then allows the attached wheel to propulse the board.</p>
